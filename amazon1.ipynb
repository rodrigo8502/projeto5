even a braided cable stop working after a year, i have used both Anker and Apple store strong braided cable they all stop working after a year so please don't buy high end cables just for that instead choose a this one and even if it's stops working withing a year you only loose 150rs compares to 2000rs.UPDATE------------------------------------pin has stopped charging from one side, now i have to slip the pin to charge from other side, but i will update and let know for how long does it work,,It’s good. Not sure about durability as the pin area feels a bit fragile,Does not support apple carplaySo was little disappointed about thatOther than that cable is made up of very good quality,Best to buy,100% NOT FATHFUL,Writing this review post 10 months and 3 orders of the same product.Honestly Portronics Konnect L lightning cable works like magic with the original Apple charging brick.Seeing the price of the cable I initially hesitated buying as it was as low as ₹99/- with the offers and so I wasn’t sure if it would work well with my iPhone 12 or whether it would impact my iPhone’s battery health because all the other lightning cable brands were costing over ₹350/- like Wayona, Amazon Basics, etc.Earlier I was using Wayona Brand lightning cable with eventually frayed and stopped working.Charging Speed:Charges my iPhone fast enough almost similar compared to the original cable level when used with 12W Original Apple power adapter.Quality and Durability:Great quality braided cable and doesn’t tangle easily and can withstand day-to-day usage.L-Shaped pin:This is very innovative by Portronics and it makes sure the cable doesn’t get damaged even if used while charging.CarPlay and Data Sync:Works smoothly with CarPlay and syncs data effortlessly.PS: I have used this cable only with the Original Apple Charging Brick and extremely satisfied with its performance.,Better than I expect the product I like that Quality and I plan to buy same type cable come with usb C to Lighting cable for emergency purpose that much I love this cable. Buy for this cable only emergency uses only since Good one,Good product and value for money</td><td>https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31VzNhhqifL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg</td><td>https://www.amazon.in/Portronics-Konnect-POR-1080-Charging-Function/dp/B08CF3B7N1/ref=sr_1_5?qid=1672909124&s=electronics&sr=1-5</td></tr><tr><td>B08Y1TFSP6</td><td>pTron Solero TB301 3A Type-C Data and Fast Charging Cable, Made in India, 480Mbps Data Sync, Strong and Durable 1.5-Meter Nylon Braided USB Cable for Type-C Devices for Charging Adapter (Black)</td><td>Computers&Accessories|Accessories&Peripherals|Cables&Accessories|Cables|USBCables</td><td>149.0</td><td>1000.0</td><td>85.0</td><td>3.9</td><td>348.2177914110429</td><td>Fast Charging & Data Sync: Solero TB301 Type-C cable supports fast charge up to 5V/3A for devices and data syncing speed up to 480Mbps.|Universal Compatibility: This USB charging cable connects USB Type-C devices with standard USB devices like laptops, hard drives, power banks, wall and car chargers, etc..Connector One: Reversible Type C|Connector Two: USB A Type|Rough & Tough Type-C Cable: Charging cable with a double-braided exterior, premium aramid fiber core and metal plugs.

I tried lubuntu 20 and ubuntu 22, it worked out of the box in both, didn't have to do any setup. There's an extender cable so you can place this in a comfortable place.

This is a big plus as it is easy plug in and use, add to it the good sober design.Build Quality:The build quality is undoubtedly superb. Just no qualms about that, at all. When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet. I mean even our old bluetooth used to connect to about 15 ft.So 20-25 feet is not at all an issue with this. This is the big plus I found with the product.Experience:From this point of view, so far except the linux non-compatibility issue, I found no other flaws with this product.So overall its a great product.Warranty:Its 3 years so I am assured that atleast for 3 years I am tension-free and not just 1 year, contrary to most electronic items today that only provide 1 year warranty with their items.,Best adapter I have bought ever.

I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn't ever thought that this cable will be so long it's good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.",

Not sure about durability as the pin area feels a bit fragile,Does not support apple carplaySo was little disappointed about thatOther than that cable is made up of very good quality,Best to buy,100% NOT FATHFUL,Writing this review post 10 months and 3 orders of the same product.Honestly Portronics Konnect L lightning cable works like magic with the original Apple charging brick.Seeing the price of the cable I initially hesitated buying as it was as low as ₹99/- with the offers and so I wasn’t sure if it would work well with my iPhone 12 or whether it would impact my iPhone’s battery health because all the other lightning cable brands were costing over ₹350/- like Wayona, Amazon Basics, etc.Earlier I was using Wayona Brand lightning cable with eventually frayed and stopped working.Charging Speed:Charges my iPhone fast enough almost similar compared to the original cable level when used with 12W Original Apple power adapter.Quality and Durability:Great quality braided cable and doesn’t tangle easily and can withstand day-to-day usage.L-Shaped pin:This is very innovative by Portronics and it makes sure the cable doesn’t get damaged even if used while charging.CarPlay and Data Sync:Works smoothly with CarPlay and syncs data effortlessly.PS: I have used this cable only with the Original Apple Charging Brick and extremely satisfied with its performance.,Better than I expect the product I like that Quality and I plan to buy same type cable come with usb C to Lighting cable for emergency purpose that much I love this cable. Buy for this cable only emergency uses only since Good one,Good product and value for money",

Signal strength is good.... just wonder what would be different in other adapters of lesser known brands which are available at a much more competitive pricing, hence a star less.,Pros:*Easy to use & Portable*Can be connected to Mobile Hotspot and used in PC( Budget Friendly)*Less installation process*No heating issues & Good Coverage*Best alternative for USB Tethering (phone's battery may get damaged for long term run with Tethering)Cons:*Internet connection speed varies at times, also depends on your modem or cellular connection*Issues occur while installing via CD, which is available along with the product( Installation driver can be downloaded from TP-Link site)*Needed to reconnect the adapter every time system is turned ON*Will not work if your software has some issues, so encountered any just update your system(worked for me)*Support Center is worse, calls are unattended most of the times or just visit nearby storeConclusion:Brought this @499/-Ideal for users who don't need very high speed internet usage,a good alternative for USB Tethering and are on Budge(1080p Youtube videos can be easily played with this without any interruptions),wifi connectivity is a great good result for me. however, some jitter problems did exist.,This is perfect device to connect wifi. Go for it.,This wifi adopter is good working,(Pictures attached)Size/Design:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Build Quality: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Packaging:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Software:  ★ ★ ★ ★Speed:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Connectivity:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Experience:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Warranty:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Size and Design:The best part about this is that it is very compact in size and very sober and elegant in design. This is a big plus as it is easy plug in and use, add to it the good sober design.Build Quality:The build quality is undoubtedly superb. Just no qualms about that, at all. When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet. I mean even our old bluetooth used to connect to about 15 ft.So 20-25 feet is not at all an issue with this. This is the big plus I found with the product.Experience:From this point of view, so far except the linux non-compatibility issue, I found no other flaws with this product.So overall its a great product.Warranty:Its 3 years so I am assured that atleast for 3 years I am tension-free and not just 1 year, contrary to most electronic items today that only provide 1 year warranty with their items.,Best adapter I have bought ever. Works nicely seemless connectivity",

I already has a Micro USB cable from Ambrane and it's still in good shape. I connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues. I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn't ever thought that this cable will be so long it's good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.",

    "Algumas colunas numéricas foram tratadas como object o que dificultou a conversão para float. Quando o pandas lê uma coluna como object, ele pode ter dificuldades em tratar valores que contenham tanto texto quanto números ou símbolos. Isso ocorre porque o tipo object no pandas é utilizado para strings ou outros tipos misturados, como listas ou dicionários.Por isso, as colunas foram convertidas para  string (astype(str)) pois o pandas pode lidar melhor com a limpeza de dados, já que ele sabe que os dados são apenas texto.\n",
    "A conversão para string foi uma forma de garantir que o pandas tratasse todas as entradas como strings, o que facilita a aplicação de funções como replace() para limpar os símbolos e vírgulas. Depois que a coluna foi convertida para string e os caracteres indesejados foram removidos, a conversão para float se tornou bem-sucedida porque os dados estavam mais consistentes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assim, as colunas numéricas que continham valores numericos e texto misturados foram convertidos para string. Usei o replace() com expressões regulares para remover ₹ e as vírgulas nas colunas de preços e rating_count. A função pd.to_numeric() é usada para converter as colunas para numérico. Com errors='coerce', valores que não podem ser convertidos (por exemplo, texto ou valores inválidos) serão convertidos para NaN.Foi realizada a conversão para float para realizar operações numéricas e plotar gráficos de maneira eficaz. Foram plotados histogramas para visualizar a distribuição de dados e também foram gerados gráficos de dispersão. Foram também verificados valores nulos na coluna ratings e rating count e foram tratados utilizando-se a média.\n",
    "Usei dtypes para verificar se as colunas foram convertidas corretamente para float e eu usei pyspark para verificar os valores duplicados.Eu também ordenei os dados por preço e rating e agrupei por categoria para calcular a média de preço com base na categoria para preparar os dados de uma maneira que facilite a visualização e análise.\n"

    "O preço com desconto e o preço real estão altamente correlacionados, o que é esperado pois o preço com desconto é uma redução do preço original. A correlação negativa entre o preço com desconto e a porcentagem de desconto é relativamente fraca. Um preço mais baixo com desconto não implica diretamente em uma porcentagem de desconto maior e vice-versa. Existe uma correlação fraca entre a avaliação e o número de avaliações. Isso significa que o número de avaliações não tem uma grande influência sobre a avaliação média, indicando que, independentemente de quantas pessoas avaliaram o produto, a média das avaliações pode variar de maneira independente.A correlação entre avaliação e porcentagem de desconto é fraca e negativa. Isso sugere que produtos com descontos maiores não necessariamente têm avaliações mais baixas ou mais altas. \n"

Not sure about durability as the pin area feels a bit fragile,Does not support apple carplaySo was little disappointed about thatOther than that cable is made up of very good quality,Best to buy,100% NOT FATHFUL,Writing this review post 10 months and 3 orders of the same product.Honestly Portronics Konnect L lightning cable works like magic with the original Apple charging brick.Seeing the price of the cable I initially hesitated buying as it was as low as ₹99/- with the offers and so I wasn’t sure if it would work well with my iPhone 12 or whether it would impact my iPhone’s battery health because all the other lightning cable brands were costing over ₹350/- like Wayona, Amazon Basics, etc.Earlier I was using Wayona Brand lightning cable with eventually frayed and stopped working.Charging Speed:Charges my iPhone fast enough almost similar compared to the original cable level when used with 12W Original Apple power adapter.Quality and Durability:Great quality braided cable and doesn’t tangle easily and can withstand day-to-day usage.L-Shaped pin:This is very innovative by Portronics and it makes sure the cable doesn’t get damaged even if used while charging.CarPlay and Data Sync:Works smoothly with CarPlay and syncs data effortlessly.PS: I have used this cable only with the Original Apple Charging Brick and extremely satisfied with its performance.,Better than I expect the product I like that Quality and I plan to buy same type cable come with usb C to Lighting cable for emergency purpose that much I love this cable. Buy for this cable only emergency uses only since Good one,Good product and value for money</td><td>https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31VzNhhqifL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg</td><td>https://www.amazon.in/Portronics-Konnect-POR-1080-Charging-Function/dp/B08CF3B7N1/ref=sr_1_5?qid=1672909124&s=electronics&sr=1-5</td></tr><tr><td>B08Y1TFSP6</td><td>pTron Solero TB301 3A Type-C Data and Fast Charging Cable, Made in India, 480Mbps Data Sync, Strong and Durable 1.5-Meter Nylon Braided USB Cable for Type-C Devices for Charging Adapter (Black)</td><td>Computers&Accessories|Accessories&Peripherals|Cables&Accessories|Cables|USBCables</td><td>149.0</td><td>1000.0</td><td>85.0</td><td>3.9</td><td>348.2177914110429</td><td>Fast Charging & Data Sync: Solero TB301 Type-C cable supports fast charge up to 5V/3A for devices and data syncing speed up to 480Mbps.|Universal Compatibility: This USB charging cable connects USB Type-C devices with standard USB devices like laptops, hard drives, power banks, wall and car chargers, etc..Connector One: Reversible Type C|Connector Two: USB A Type|Rough & Tough Type-C Cable: Charging cable with a double-braided exterior, premium aramid fiber core and metal plugs.

I tried lubuntu 20 and ubuntu 22, it worked out of the box in both, didn't have to do any setup. There's an extender cable so you can place this in a comfortable place.

This is a big plus as it is easy plug in and use, add to it the good sober design.Build Quality:The build quality is undoubtedly superb. Just no qualms about that, at all. When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet. I mean even our old bluetooth used to connect to about 15 ft.So 20-25 feet is not at all an issue with this. This is the big plus I found with the product.Experience:From this point of view, so far except the linux non-compatibility issue, I found no other flaws with this product.So overall its a great product.Warranty:Its 3 years so I am assured that atleast for 3 years I am tension-free and not just 1 year, contrary to most electronic items today that only provide 1 year warranty with their items.,Best adapter I have bought ever.

I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.",

Not sure about durability as the pin area feels a bit fragile,Does not support apple carplaySo was little disappointed about thatOther than that cable is made up of very good quality,Best to buy,100% NOT FATHFUL,Writing this review post 10 months and 3 orders of the same product.Honestly Portronics Konnect L lightning cable works like magic with the original Apple charging brick.Seeing the price of the cable I initially hesitated buying as it was as low as ₹99/- with the offers and so I wasn’t sure if it would work well with my iPhone 12 or whether it would impact my iPhone’s battery health because all the other lightning cable brands were costing over ₹350/- like Wayona, Amazon Basics, etc.Earlier I was using Wayona Brand lightning cable with eventually frayed and stopped working.Charging Speed:Charges my iPhone fast enough almost similar compared to the original cable level when used with 12W Original Apple power adapter.Quality and Durability:Great quality braided cable and doesn’t tangle easily and can withstand day-to-day usage.L-Shaped pin:This is very innovative by Portronics and it makes sure the cable doesn’t get damaged even if used while charging.CarPlay and Data Sync:Works smoothly with CarPlay and syncs data effortlessly.PS: I have used this cable only with the Original Apple Charging Brick and extremely satisfied with its performance.,Better than I expect the product I like that Quality and I plan to buy same type cable come with usb C to Lighting cable for emergency purpose that much I love this cable. Buy for this cable only emergency uses only since Good one,Good product and value for money",

Signal strength is good.... just wonder what would be different in other adapters of lesser known brands which are available at a much more competitive pricing, hence a star less.,Pros:*Easy to use & Portable*Can be connected to Mobile Hotspot and used in PC( Budget Friendly)*Less installation process*No heating issues & Good Coverage*Best alternative for USB Tethering (phone's battery may get damaged for long term run with Tethering)Cons:*Internet connection speed varies at times, also depends on your modem or cellular connection*Issues occur while installing via CD, which is available along with the product( Installation driver can be downloaded from TP-Link site)*Needed to reconnect the adapter every time system is turned ON*Will not work if your software has some issues, so encountered any just update your system(worked for me)*Support Center is worse, calls are unattended most of the times or just visit nearby storeConclusion:Brought this @499/-Ideal for users who don't need very high speed internet usage,a good alternative for USB Tethering and are on Budge(1080p Youtube videos can be easily played with this without any interruptions),wifi connectivity is a great good result for me. however, some jitter problems did exist.,This is perfect device to connect wifi. Go for it.,This wifi adopter is good working,(Pictures attached)Size/Design:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Build Quality: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Packaging:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Software:  ★ ★ ★ ★Speed:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Connectivity:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Experience:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Warranty:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Size and Design:The best part about this is that it is very compact in size and very sober and elegant in design. This is a big plus as it is easy plug in and use, add to it the good sober design.Build Quality:The build quality is undoubtedly superb. Just no qualms about that, at all. When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet. I mean even our old bluetooth used to connect to about 15 ft.So 20-25 feet is not at all an issue with this. This is the big plus I found with the product.Experience:From this point of view, so far except the linux non-compatibility issue, I found no other flaws with this product.So overall its a great product.Warranty:Its 3 years so I am assured that atleast for 3 years I am tension-free and not just 1 year, contrary to most electronic items today that only provide 1 year warranty with their items.,Best adapter I have bought ever. Works nicely seemless connectivity",

I already has a Micro USB cable from Ambrane and it's still in good shape. I connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues. I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn't ever thought that this cable will be so long it's good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.",

    "Os resultados sugerem que o percentual de desconto tem um impacto limitado na média de avaliação dos produtos. Mesmo com produtos sem descontos, a média de avaliação é de 4.24, o que é relativamente alto. Com descontos muito altos, como 90%, a média de avaliação é de 3.98, que ainda é uma avaliação razoável, mas chega a ter uma menor avaliação que os produtos sem desconto. Isso indica que o desconto não é o principal fator que influencia a avaliação.Outros fatores, como a qualidade do produto e a marca, provavelmente têm um impacto maior.\n",
    "É importante considerar outros fatores e realizar análises adicionais para obter uma compreensão mais completa da relação entre desconto e avaliação."

    "Ao concluir o trabalho, acredito que consegui atingir os objetivos principais que defini no início do projeto. O foco estava em entender a relação entre preço, desconto e avaliação dos produtos na plataforma de e-commerce Amazon, e, ao longo da análise, obtive insights valiosos sobre essas variáveis. Consegui calcular a média dos preços originais e com desconto, o que permitiu observar que, em média, os produtos têm descontos significativos. Esse foi um ponto importante para entender a estratégia de precificação da Amazon. Realizamos uma análise dos descontos por categoria, destacando que produtos de diferentes categorias possuem políticas de descontos bastante variadas. Isso abriu caminho para um entendimento das estratégias de preços da plataforma, dependendo do tipo de produto. Também analisei as médias de avaliação por categoria de produto, identificando que a satisfação dos consumidores varia significativamente. Categorias como acessórios de computador e eletrônicos tiveram as melhores avaliações, enquanto produtos de áudio e cozinha receberam avaliações mais baixas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Durante a análise dos dados, percebi que, apesar dos descontos serem relevantes, eles não são os únicos fatores que afetam as avaliações. Em alguns casos, como os produtos com descontos muito altos, a média de avaliação foi ligeiramente inferior à de produtos sem desconto, o que indica que outras variáveis poderiam estar influenciando essas avaliações.\n",
    "Outro desafio foi a diferenciação das categorias de produtos, especialmente em categorias amplas como \"acessórios\", onde as subcategorias podem ter características muito distintas. Isso fez com que algumas análises se tornassem mais complexas do que o esperado.\n",
    "\n",
    "Para enriquecer a análise, seria interessante aprofundar a investigação sobre as relações entre outros fatores e as avaliações, como a marca, a qualidade do produto e a frequência de compra. Isso ajudaria a entender melhor como esses aspectos influenciam a percepção do consumidor.Outra análise relevante seria a segmentação dos dados por tipo de consumidor, por exemplo, consumidores que compram frequentemente e consumidores ocasionais, para ver como a lealdade à marca ou a experiência do usuário impacta as avaliações.\n",
    "\n",
    "O trabalho ajudou a entender as relações entre preço, desconto e avaliação, embora haja espaço para expandir a análise com mais variáveis. A descoberta de que o desconto não é o fator determinante para as avaliações reforça a importância de considerar uma gama mais ampla de fatores ao analisar o comportamento do consumidor em plataformas de e-commerce. Esse projeto contribuiu para o meu entendimento de estratégias de preços e mostrou como é possível usar dados para entender melhor o comportamento do consumidor.\n",
